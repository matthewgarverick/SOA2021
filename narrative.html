        <p><br>On a warm, sunny midsummer day, the Athens air is filled with the sound of chimes clanging together in
            the wind down Grosvenor Street.</br>

            <br>Many of them are pieces crafted by Athens’ own Dan Copper.</br>

            <br>The middle-aged man with a long, wiry beard typically can be found on his front porch, surrounded by his
            own masterpieces and crafting the next out of aluminum, glass, wood and copper, eager to greet a passing
            stranger who takes notice of his work.</br>

            <br>“On sunny days, [with my house] so close to the sidewalk, and I sit out there do work and have half a
            dozen
            people come by in an evening and stop and talk and ask questions and tell me what they like,” he said,
            adding that passersby will “occasionally buy something.”</p></br>

        <h1>But, for Copper, sales are but a secondary perk to his artistic endeavors.</h1>

        <h1>The work required to create Copper’s mobiles is tedious. Preparing the wire, wrapping the marbles and
            finding the perfect point of balance to suspend the pieces can at times be difficult and a long process
            of trial and error. Photo by Dylan Benedict</h1>

    <div class="narrativestory2">
        <h1> Born to Create</h1>
        <p><br>His father being a classically trained musician, and his mother a prima ballerina, creativity naturally
            runs through Copper’s veins.</br>

            <br> “When I was so young that I had to hold myself up on the edge of the crib — the playpen — I would
            boogie my little butt off to the classical string quartets all the time,” Copper said.</br>

            <br>Born with a moniker he declines to share, a childhood name change was the result of exuberant creativity
            and no real tie to his given last name. His alias allows his art to truly be a part of his
            self-identity.</br>

            <br>Copper acknowledges that because he’s been a creator since childhood, many of his projects have a
            certain “feel" to them. He admits finding new ideas after so many years can be a challenge.</br>

            <br>“When I get stuck for ideas, sometimes ... I go back and look at the very oldest things I have and
            think, ‘You know, was there an avenue — was there a direction I didn't pursue here?’ And then I try to do
            those,” he said.</br></p>

        <p><b>Left:</b> Copper’s porch stands out among the rest on Grosvenor Street. A hodgepodge of his creations and
            other odds and ends he enjoys, the porch is a definite point of interest. On days when the weather is nice,
            Copper can often be seen sitting in his chair striking up conversation with passersby interested in his
            collection. <b>Right:</b> Illuminated by the sun, the marbles Copper uses for his mobiles look even more
            dazzling.
            They came from Jabo Inc., a now closed marble factory that was based out of Parkersburg, WV. Before they
            closed, Copper managed to get 2 tons of marbles from the factory. Photos by Dylan Benedict</p>

        <h1>Raiding the Dumpster for Treasures Untold</h1>
        <p><br>For Copper, his creative outlet comes not just in the form of a finished project, but also from the
            process of gathering materials for each masterpiece. He is constantly on the hunt for discarded items, and
            he delights in turning another’s “trash” into various forms, such as wind chimes, earrings, mobiles or
            copper designs.</br>

            <br>“You never know what you're gonna find. There's a lot of [trash], and sometimes I am directly inspired
            by what I find,” he said, adding that “taking stuff out of the waste stream” motivates him to keep creating
            on the rare days when inspiration is lacking.</br>

            <br>“Waste appalls me. People just don't make any effort. You know, you work hard for the things you buy.
            People spend their whole lives doing jobs — a lot of the jobs they really don't like — to buy stuff that
            they just throw away.”</br></p>

        <p>Starting when he was 13 years old, Copper has “ran a rock tumbler for over 40 years.” Originally tumbling
            rocks and minerals, he later moved onto polishing pieces of glass. He has polished salvaged glass from Sky
            Vodka bottles, old mason jars, art pieces and anything else made of quality glass. Some pieces have even
            spent up to two months in the tumbler to get the perfect polish. Photo by Dylan Benedict</p>

    <div class="narrativestory4">


        <h1>A creator, a non comformist - but not an artist</h1>
        <p><br>“I don't often use that word [artist] applied to myself,” he said. “I call it ‘my creative work.’ I'm not
            sure how I would define art ... for me, it's, well, it's the most important thing in my life really, if my
            creative work means nothing, my life means nothing.”</br>

            <br>Copper, who’s held many odd jobs over the years, decided a few years ago to turn his passion for
            creative projects into a business, oftentimes attending festivals and fairs to sell his artwork.</br>

            <br>While he’s a very hands-on creative person, Copper admits his minimal lifestyle without social media and
            internet presents obstacles to selling his work, and he relies mostly on word-of-mouth referrals.</br></p>

        <h1>Made from aluminum tent poles, recycled electrical wire and old turkey pans, this mobile is one of the
            largest Copper has ever created. It spans about nine feet across and was commissioned by the mayor of
            Athens, Ohio. Now residing in the Athens City Hall, Copper said he wanted “to hang some interesting fun
            things in the building” to make visits more enjoyable. Photo by Dylan Benedict</h1>
        <p><br>One of Copper’s more noticeable pieces includes the mobile hanging inside the Athens City Hall building.
            Because it was installed at the same time public facilities in Ohio began to close last March, publicity for
            the piece has been limited.</br>

            <br>“I've never really been that sales-oriented. But between the festivals, and reuse industries and the
            mayor's mobile, things were starting to really look like they were going to work,” he said. “With the
            mayor's mobile, he was talking photo opportunities, calling in the newspapers, putting up a plaque and of
            course, it all shut down.”</br>

            <br>For now, Copper’s pieces can be purchased on a Facebook page maintained by Jacqueline Krim, an unlikely
            ally to his business. Of course, Copper also continues to welcome visitors to his porch, where fresh air and
            social distancing provide what he considers adequate protection from the virus.</br></p>
