        <p>On February 28, 2021, our team met Dan at his home to capture his personality and artistic process.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="firstlandingstory">
        <p class="has-dropcap">As the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on businesses around the globe, local creator Dan
            Copper found himself struggling to keep his business afloat. In the midst of a summer devoid of public
            gatherings, Copper, whose sales and socialization primarily come
            from summertime fairs and festivals, found more than groceries at Busy Day Market. Located just down the
            street from the front porch where he creates his signature wind chimes, jewelry and other metal arts, the
            market is where he first met Jacqueline Krim.

        </p>

    <div class="firstlandingstory2">
        <p><b>It’s kismet<br></b>
            Krim, a December graduate of Ohio University’s civil engineering program, has been working at Busy Day since
            the summer of 2020 when her internship was canceled due to the pandemic. 

            “I was supposed to go back to the place I interned last summer, in 2019,” Krim said. “It got cancelled
            because of COVID, so I moved down here.”

            Because Copper frequents the corner store most of the employees know his name. Making small talk, the
            artist, who lives alone, spoke with Krim about his distaste for rain but conceded that it was great for his
            plants.

            That sparked a conversation. </p>

        <p><b>Gifting plants and growing friendship</b><br>
            “Three days later, there was a plant sitting [in the store] … for me, and I asked my co-workers, ‘Where'd
            that come from? Did we get a plant at Busy Day?’ That's, like, not a thing — so out of character for us -—
            but they're like, ‘No, Dan brought it for you,’” Krim said. “Truthfully, [he was the] first person ever,
            first guy ever to give me like a plant.”</p>

        <p2>After she thanked him, Copper began to share resources about plant-care with Krim and has gifted her
            many
            more plants since the first.</p2>



         
    </div>

    <div class="secondlandingstorypt2">
        <p>“I now have 57 in my apartment, and 30 I think are from him,” she said.

            Though she indicated her plant collection is massive, it pales in comparison to Copper’s own.”</p>

        <p2>After she thanked him, Copper began to share resources about plant-care with Krim and has gifted her
            many
            more plants since the first.</p2>



         
    </div>

    <div class="secondlandingstorypt3">
        <p>“I had over 500 house plants at one point. But I'm trying, believe it or not, to simplify my life. I need to
            downsize seriously,” Copper said, and so he continued to transplant pieces of his own indoor garden into
            Krim’s home.

            <b>A kindness is returned</b><br>
            The more Krim got to know Copper and his generosity, the more she wanted to repay him by finding a way to
            sell his art despite the pandemic-related shutdowns. So, she began photographing his work and posting it for
            sale on Facebook marketplace.</p>

        <p2>“When I found out that he used almost 100% recycled material, I was like, ‘I think we were meant to meet,’”
            said Krim, who focused on environmental engineering during her undergraduate education. “Then he told me his
            financial issues and I was like, ‘I have a social media platform as a 22-year-old.’ So I ... decided like we
            were meant to meet — I'm gonna help.”

            “It's a lifesaver,” Copper said of Krim’s social media work. “I was seriously worried about running out of
            money.”</p2>

    <div class="thirdlandingstory">
        <p><b>Dark times ahead, but hope perseveres</b><br>
            While Copper says he’s grateful for Krim’s assistance, he acknowledges that even with the few expenses he
            does have, things are still a struggle.</p>
        <p2>“I really live on so little. I don't need much. But, you know, there is rent and utilities, and I do eat
            some. Some — not very much these days,” he said. “And yes, I drink beer. I do drink the cheapest, strongest
            beer I can find. Not because it's my favorite, but because it's cheap and strong.”
        </p2>

         
    </div>
    <div class="thirdlandingstory2">
        <p>Before the shutdowns, Copper said he was planning to be a vendor for the third year in a row at Wisteria, a
            campground in Pomeroy, Ohio that holds festivals during the summer months. Had his revenues followed the
            trend of his past two years at Wisteria, Copper said he may have sold enough of his wares to pay a full
            year’s worth of expenses.</p>
        <p2>Instead, Copper expressed he might need to find roommates to help with some of the household expenses.
        </p2>

        <p>“There's a very good chance I'm gonna lose this house soon,” he said. “And I really am not equipped to deal
            with that. … (I) literally don't know what I'm gonna do.” </p>
        <p2>To support Copper in his time of need, his creations are available for purchase on Facebook marketplace. and
